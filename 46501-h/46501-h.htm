  <h2 class='c003'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004' >It is hoped that the following short
stories, which the writer has endeavoured
to tell in the simplest language, will give
some idea of the inner feelings and
belief of a people whose individuality is,
despite the number of years we have
been in contact with them, little known
to the large majority of us. Even among
those well versed in the language and
the practical or legal customs of the
natives, there are few who are acquainted
with the undercurrents of thought, and
the many traditions and superstitions,
which are accepted without question by
the Zulus, and which form an essential
part of the mental life of all among them
who have not had their ideas modified to
some extent by European teaching, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vi' id='Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
which continue to have a strong hold
upon the larger number even of those
who have had the advantages of some
kind of education at the hands of the
missionaries and other teachers. The
common estimate of the African native
is that he is a being with no ideas above
his cattle and his physical wants; but
a more intimate acquaintance with their
life, such as the writer had from being
amongst them for many years at her
father’s mission station in Zululand, will
reveal that the native has an ideal life
of his own. This, it is true, is in
many instances of a crude and savage
character; yet it rises a little, if only a
little, above what is “of the earth,
earthly,” and, though it may possibly
provoke a smile on account of its crudeness
or simplicity, it will at times strike
a chord of sympathy as a touch of nature—as
an aspiration, however feeble, to
penetrate beyond the veil which hides
the unseen world from human eyes.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vii' id='Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
Those who have made the folklore of
savage or half-civilized peoples their
study cannot fail to be struck with the
strange analogy between some of the
superstitions of the Zulus and those of
many other nations. Vague and undefined
as some of their native ideas are,
there is still a belief in the existence of
a spirit world around them by which
their lives are affected, and a groping
after a knowledge of influences beyond
human power, which direct the destinies
of mortal man, and of mysterious forces
which can be brought into play by
men peculiarly gifted. In their custom
of sacrificing to the spirits, to induce
them to restore the health of a patient,
and their belief in the powers of wizards,
we find them under the thraldom of the
same superstitions which have become
familiar to us in so many and such diverse
directions—from the ancient Greeks to
the modern spiritualists—and which have
at times played so great a part in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_viii' id='Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
history of the world. Their belief in the
“spirits of their fathers” watching over
them is similar to the idea underlying
Chinese ancestral worship, and the
wizard’s powers of killing or injuring do
not differ in essentials from the so-called
spirit healing of enlightened America or
the working of the “evil eye” still believed
in by the ignorant among the peasantry
of Italy. If, therefore, in reading of the
Zulu superstitions we are provoked at
times to smile, it must be rather at the
form than at the substance. The superstitions
are the same that have ever
existed, and that, despite all our advancement,
still find adherents among civilized
communities, though among these they
are expressed in more delicate language
and acted upon in less savage ways.
With the large mass of Europeans such
superstitions, thanks to modern enlightenment,
are taken at their true value; but
so long as there are among ourselves
people who believe in planchettes, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_ix' id='Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
cannot quite afford to look with supercilious
contempt upon the African who
believes in wizards. And there is one
point of view in which a knowledge of
what he believes is of material importance.
To him, these superstitions are
realities. He accepts them as facts of
which he has to take account, and which
will be acted upon by the society in which
his lot is cast. To estimate his true
character, and form any accurate idea of
the manner in which his mind will work,
some knowledge not only of his customs
but also of his social habits and beliefs is
thus essential.</p>

<p class='c005' >The author therefore trusts that the
present small work may prove not only of
some scholastic value, but may also be of
practical use to the missionary, the
administrator, and, indeed, to all who
come into contact with the little understood
“Native,” or who are interested in
his progress and well-being.</p>

<i>The Author of these sketches is deeply indebted to
Miss A. Werner for the pains she took to introduce a
few of them, through the “Journal of the African
Society,” to the notice of many of those gentlemen who,
having held the highest positions in South Africa, or
been in supreme power over the Zulu Nation, know how
important it is that those who hold the destinies of this
interesting people in their hands should understand as
much as possible of the bias of their minds and the springs
of their conduct. But for their generous expression of
this opinion, it is doubtful whether this little volume
would ever have struggled to the light. To them she
is profoundly grateful, as she is also to those whose
ready support has enabled her to bring her venture to
a successful issue. She wishes also to acknowledge the
valuable assistance received from the ex-President of
the Folk-lore Society and the Secretaries of the Royal
Colonial Institute and the African Society.</i></p>

  <h2 class='c010'>UMTIMBA<br /><span class='small'>(A ZULU WEDDING)</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c004' >There is much ceremony connected with
a heathen Zulu wedding. A month or more
before the time the bridegroom-elect has to
compose a song to be sung by him and his party.
Then he invites all the young men in the neighbourhood
to come and learn it; he also composes
a tune to suit it, which they all have to practise
singing together, whilst dancing and manœuvring
about, beating time with their feet. All his sisters,
with their friends, join in as well. The song is
generally made up of a very few words, something
like a round in three or four parts. Here is one,
for example:—</p>

<p class='c011' >“Kusiqingile. Sesipiwe amabosho.” (We are
in a fix. We are now supplied with cartridges.)</p>

<p class='c005' >I was once present at a wedding where the
following was sung: “Wen ‘obem’ ugwai,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
Kauseikuza ini?” (You who take snuff. Will you
never die?) This was the bridegroom’s song. He
had managed to set it to quite a nice tune, and it
went with a swing, the men keeping time beautifully
with their feet, and flourishing their sticks in the
air.</p>

<p class='c005' >The bride-elect, too, has to go through the same
preparations a month beforehand. She composes
her song, and makes a tune for it, then all her
friends have to come and learn it. The afternoons
are generally set apart for this, and nice moonlight
nights, when they can keep it up till the small hours
of the morning. The words of the song may be:
“Yek’ ubugontshi! Ngashiy’ umame.” (What
trouble! I left mother.) Or, “Kuya ngotando.
Ngishiy’abakwetu.” (It is my choice. I left my
people.) After the day has been fixed for the
Umtimba and everything is ready for it, the father
sends two cows on ahead the day before, to be put
for the bride in the cattle kraal of her future home.
This is a sign that she will be leaving her home in
the afternoon with her “udwendwe” (bridesmaids
and party); and a hut is then prepared at once to
receive them when they arrive in the evening—the
eve of her wedding day. When the udwendwe
reaches the kraal, a great noise of singing and
clapping of hands is heard, this being the signal of
their arrival. Most girls carry small stones in
their hands so as to make a louder noise. Clapping
at the gate, they are met by someone who invites
them to enter, and leads the way to the hut prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
for them. In this hut they sit up all night,
singing and talking, until about dawn, when they
make a move towards a bush, chosen in the neighbourhood,
where they settle down to breakfast. In
this place they spend the greater part of the
forenoon, cooking and feasting, Meat and beer is
sent to them from the bride’s future home. At
about 8 in the morning the first messenger is sent
by the bridegroom to invite the bride to come up;
but he doesn’t return, nor is he expected to do
otherwise than remain there, for this is a part of
the marriage ceremony. The bridegroom again
sends another messenger with the same message;
he also remains, and others are sent again soon
after. This goes on till there are about forty or
fifty men sent off to fetch the bride and party.
Lastly a beast is sent down, and that makes the
bride think it is about time she prepared to move.
She then begins to put on her bridal ornaments
which consist chiefly of a new skin skirt, made of
an ox-hide, well greased and perfumed with
“amaka,” white ox tails on her arms and wrists,
white and green beads (buma) round her neck,
waist and ankles, sakabula feathers (Umnyakanya)
on her head—a veil of beads (Invakaza) over her
face, and a knife or an assagai in her hand, to
flourish about whilst dancing. When the bridesmaids
have finished assisting her they put on their
finery; then they surround the bride and screen
her with mats, so that no one can possibly see her
before she appears before her future husband, whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
part it is to see her first. She is thus carefully
hidden all the way, but now and then she puts up
her knife just to show whereabouts in the crowd
she is. The bridegroom is generally found seated
with some of his best friends on the ground in the
cattle kraal or outside it, and the bride is brought
before him in this fashion. When very near, the
crowd falls back and the maids are allowed to come
forward with their screened-up treasure, which is
unveiled before him by drawing aside the mats. She
kneels down and whispers the usual few words
into his ears, which are: “Sengifikile. Ungipate
kahle. Ungilahle nami sengiyakukulahla.” (I
have now come. You’ll treat me well. You’ll
bury me and I’ll bury you.) To which he answers:
“Kulungile pelanawe ungipate kahle.” (Agreed.
You treat me well too.) After this the maids
have their say (pela nawe), warning him to treat
her kindly and lovingly or he may live to suffer for
it, &amp;c. They may say anything to him at this time.
Then the old women come forward dancing in and
out amongst the girls. They carry a mealie cob
stuck on the point of an assagai. This they flourish
about in the air for luck and prosperity. While
this is going on the bridegroom and party hurry
off to deck themselves out in their finery. This is
always done after the bride has arrived. He wears
a grand umutsha (kilt), made of cowhide and skin
of an intsimangu (monkey), also white ox tails
round his legs and arms, isaka (head ornament) of
sakabula (long-tailed finch) feathers on his head,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
and he carries a knobkerrie and courting shield in
his hand. If he is an ikehla (man with ring on
his head) he has to wear a neat little isiqova
(tuft) on his forehead, made of pretty feathers, and
a longer one at the back of his head.</p>

<p class='c005' >When the bridegroom comes forward again with
all his escort the dancing begins in earnest. His
song is then rendered for the admiration of the
bridal party and visitors. They go on dancing
and singing it till they are fairly exhausted; then
they sit down and rest, while the bride, assisted by
her maids, goes through her song in all its charming
variations, the old women manœuvring in and out
of the crowd with the most graceful movements
imaginable. When the bride has finished her part,
the bridegroom comes in again with his, and they
sing and dance together until dusk, when all the
people return to their homes. Beer only is provided
on that day—nothing else.</p>

<p class='c005' >The next day the wedding feast takes place;
this is called “Ukuqolisca” (breakfast or reception).
Only relations and invited guests join in this.
The bride on this day gives away all her girlish
ornaments of beads, &amp;c., to her sisters and her
husband’s sisters. She puts all the necklaces in a
vessel and pours water over them, then takes them
out, one by one, and throws them on the girls.
This is the way she gives them away.</p>

<p class='c005' >On the third day the final part of the ceremony
takes place. The bride has to try to run back to
her home, with a child on her back belonging to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
her new home, for there are often several families
in one kraal. If she is a good runner and manages
to get there without being caught she wins a cow;
but this is a very difficult thing to do, for she is
carefully watched, and the weight of the child on
her back is a great hindrance. If she is lucky
enough to win the prize her husband has to give it,
to bring her back again, and that adds to the

  <h2 class='c003'>HOW TWINS WERE TREATED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Zulus used to consider it unlucky to have twins,
and worse still to have triplets. The latter were
always thought to be monkeys, and killed as soon
as they were born. Only one of the former was
allowed to live. Sometimes parents found it difficult
to decide which one to keep, although the rule
was to kill the younger of the two. The greatest
difficulty arose when the youngest one happened to
be a girl; for by killing her a fortune was lost—it
meant losing ten or twenty head of cattle.</p>

<p class='c005' >Once a Zulu woman was in a difficulty of this
kind. She had two lovely black babes, and loved
both dearly, so she made up her mind to break the
rule and keep them. But she and her husband
suffered severely for it. They were continually
reminded of having dared to break the rule of their
country, and at last, when the twins were ten years
old, and looked handsome and promising, their
superstitious and envious neighbours threatened to
report it to King Mpande. The parents’ hearts
sank within them, so they decided to take the boy
to a mission station near, and offer him to “The
Great-great-one,” meaning God. He was accepted
and taught. In time he became a Christian. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
parents often went to see him, and his sister brought
him presents of mealies and sweet potatoes. Five
or six years went by, but still the fact that the old
man had spared his son was not forgotten. At last
the threat was carried out. He was reported at
headquarters, and accused of being a wizard as well,
because he was lucky in whatever he undertook.
He and his five wives were very industrious; they
always planted large patches of mealies, Kafir
corn (mabele), pumpkins, and sweet potatoes,
so that they often had plenty of food and to
spare when others were hard up. They were
given to hospitality, and always pleased to help
those in need, so it seemed rather strange that
they had enemies. They had ten nice young
daughters who could sing and dance well, and
about the same number of sons, who were good
hunters and kept them supplied with game.
The chief men of that district were very jealous of
this wealthy old farmer, and advised the king to do
away with him and take his property. The king
gave his consent, and almost immediately a band
of men were told off to go and kill him, and to
bring back his cattle and daughters. A company
of the famous old “Ndhlondhlo” regiment set off,
well armed with assagais, knobkerries, and shields.
As they went along they flourished their weapons in
the air with great pride. It was a good two days’
journey they had to take, to this place in the thorn
country. They arrived there about the middle of
the second night and halting a few yards away,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
surrounded the kraal and lay down to rest in
the high grass till dawn. As soon as it was
light they got up and closed in round the kraal.
The two men who were best acquainted with
the owner, and who had often visited him, went
up to the chief hut to inquire if he was stirring,
for they said they were out hunting rather early,
and would be grateful for a pinch of snuff to
freshen them up a little. The kind old man,
desirous to please as usual, opened the door of
his hut at once and came out with his snuff-box.
While he was in the act of giving them some,
a volley was discharged at him, and he fell
down dead on the spot. Women and children
came running out in confusion from all the other
huts to see what was the matter; then two of the
chief women were also killed. The other three
were left to bury their husband, which they were
soon made to do, being ordered to carry him off
and throw him into a donga. The mealie pits
were opened and destroyed. Then two fine beasts
were butchered for breakfast. The men had rather
more than they could eat, so they invited the girls
to make a good meal, for they had a two days’
journey before them to the king’s kraal. The girls
answered, “You invite us to eat while our parents’
blood is still fresh on the ground! We will not
eat. Would that we could die too, and escape
being made slaves to the king who has ruined
our happy home. Oh! ye spirits of our ancestors,
pity us and take us out of this cruel misery!”</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
The twin boy, having heard in the early hours of
the morning the fate of his people, hid in a cupboard
at the mission house. He was called for, but
he was nowhere to be found. The mission house
was searched through and through, but fortunately
no one thought he might be in the cupboard.
When they had satisfied themselves that he was
not there, they went off with the girls. It was
pitiful to hear their cries. The men had no mercy,
but went along joking and praising themselves for
having managed so remarkably well. Such was life
in Zululand before the Zulu war!</p>

<p class='c005' >Soon after this affair another Zulu woman had
twin girls, and the parents, having learnt a sad
lesson, determined to observe the custom of their
country. The younger one was killed, although
she looked the healthier and finer. She was left to
starve to death in a cold corner of the hut, while
the other one was cuddled up and kept warm and
fed. Strange to say, the chosen one pined and died
a fortnight later, and the mother regretted not
having kept the younger.</p>

<p class='c005' >This custom is no longer observed. It is now
considered lucky to have twins, especially if they
are girls; for it means twenty head of cattle for the
family at her marriage.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>“UKUGODUSA”<br /><span class='small'>(SENDING HOME)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >There are many, no doubt, who know of
the old cruel Zulu custom of “Ukugodusa”
(sending home), <i>i.e.</i>, doing away with the aged
people. If a man was too old and feeble
to go to the king’s kraal occasionally, and
join his regiment whenever called out, the
king would pick out a troop of men and say,
“Hamba niye kum’godusa”—meaning “go and
send him home.” Then this troop of men would
travel miles away to the man’s kraal, taking good
care to get there by night, and to surround it, so
as to pounce upon the poor old fellow as soon as
he came out of his hut in the morning, and take
him away to bury alive or otherwise kill him. The
victim simply had to go away obediently, knowing
it was the king’s order, as well as the custom of
his country. So all Zulu men, old and young,
used to make a point of meeting at the king’s
kraal, “Komkulu” (at the great one’s), especially
at Christmas time, to show that they were still of
service. If through illness they had to stay at
home, and it could be proved that they were
indisposed, the king excused them; but they were
most careful not to let it happen again.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
When women became helpless, and needed
looking after, they, too, had to be “sent home,” and
that was done by their own people. Even their
own sons would order it to be done, and assist in
the cruel performance. Here is one example of it.
Once, two sons, wanting to get rid of their aged
mother, tempted her out for a long walk to some
dongas (dry watercourses with deep holes in the
banks). (Zulu.) They took her to the deepest
one and pushed her into it. The poor old creature
hurt her ankle very badly, and could not get out
again. She was in that donga two days and two
nights, without food or a drop of water to drink.
Maddened by hunger she made a despairing
effort to scramble out, and fortunately managed it
at last. Once on the level she found some wild
berries and fruit, of which she made a good meal.
This gave her a little strength to decide on her
next move. Not daring to venture anywhere near
her home again, she took a long journey to a
mission station, and there begged to be taken in.
The missionary and his family were very good to
her, and gave her a home and taught her. In time
she became a Christian, and it was most touching
to hear her saying her prayers early in the morning.
She prayed most earnestly for her sons who had
forsaken her.</p>

<p class='c005' >Another old woman was daily threatened to be
“sent home,” but a certain missionary’s wife and
daughters who used to visit the kraal begged that
she should be spared. They took her some covering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
occasionally, for she was helpless and often
would sleep too near the fireplace and burn her
blankets. Years went on in this way, until the
missionary family had to take a trip to Durban
to get supplies for the year. Then the mischief
was done. On their return, great was their
distress at finding the old woman no more.
Her people had taken her to a very deep ant-bear
hole and made her go in. Before obeying
she meekly asked for a last pinch of snuff, which
they could not deny her. She sat down to take
her snuff, then stepped into the ant-bear hole.
They filled it up with earth and buried her alive.</p>

<p class='c005' >“Ukugodusa,” one is thankful to know, is out
of date now, as well as illegal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c012'>ANOTHER INSTANCE IN WHICH THE “UKUGODUSA” CUSTOM WAS CARRIED OUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >I feel that it would, perhaps, be wise to give
one more proof to show that the above was a real
custom amongst the Zulus, even as lately as in the
days of King Cetshwayo. A poor old woman
named Madokodo was another victim, besides
Mfoto whom I mentioned before. Sometime in
the beginning of 1869 Madokodo, on account of her
old age, was thrown into a donga, or pit, by one
of her sons and his friends, to get her out of the
way, or send her home (godusa), as this was called.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
The poor old body was not in her second childhood
(as Mfoto was), but was healthy and strong. She
was in this pit for a few days, trying to get out, but
kept falling back again. When night came she
was in terror of the wolves and tigers which were
prowling about the place; but she knew there was
a Great God above, and she prayed for His protection.
At last she managed to scrape a few holes in
the donga with her finger nails, and made steps to
climb up by, and the Great Almighty (Usomandhla)
gave her strength to get out. Then she went to a
great friend of hers, who fed her and kept her in a
secret corner of her kraal until she got over her shock
and became strong again. Madokodo then went
to one of her other sons by night, and he was much
pleased as well as surprised to see his mother alive;
but, fearing the elder and cruel brother might find
her and try to carry out this cruel custom again,
he thought it best not to keep her with him long,
so he proposed taking her to a mission station and
giving her to the missionary. The mother agreed
to this, and the two went off together, travelling a
good many miles till they reached St. Paul’s Mission
Station, the missionary there being my father,
Rev. S. M. Samuelson. Arriving at the door of
our house, poor old Madokodo, lame and footsore,
called out in a pleading voice, “Ngitola Baba,”
“Ngitola Nkosi Yame!” which means, “Adopt
me, Father,” “Adopt me, my Master.” My father
inquired into the matter, and all was related, her
loving son supporting her. Nothing could be done
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
but to save the poor old soul from future trouble,
and to try to win her for Christ’s Kingdom. My
father took her under his care on August 13th,
1869, and the son took leave of his mother and
returned home again. Madokodo slept in the
kitchen, and my mother took great interest in
her, for she was very intelligent, industrious and
tidy. After a while Madokodo expressed a wish to
join the Catechumen class, and be prepared for
Baptism. She was very earnest; for early in the
morning, just about sunrise, we children heard
her deep, pleading voice in prayer whilst we were
still in our beds, “Baba wami Opezulu, ovele wa
ngibheka, osangibhekile namanje, ngitola Mdali
wami, tola nabanta bami, utetelele nalo ongilahlileyo!”
(My Father above, Thou Who hast taken
care of me from the very first, and Who art still
caring for me, adopt me, my Creator, adopt also
my children, and forgive the one who has thrown
me away.”) Then she would always finish with
“The Lord’s Prayer,” which she had by then
learnt. At the end of eight months she was baptized,
and received the name Eva. She was, I believe,
the first old woman who became a Christian at
St. Paul’s, and she was very happy after that, and
helped in the mission work by setting an excellent
example to the younger converts. News of the
aged woman’s conversion and baptism spread all
over the country like wildfire, for Zulus, as a rule,
are great news carriers. Her wicked son heard of
it, for he had hoped she had reached her destination
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
long ago, as he had “sent her home.” The
middle-aged people bore her a grudge on account
of her having become a Christian at her age, and,
fearing others might do the same, clubbed together
and made plans to get her out of the way; so they
accused her of witchcraft and reported her to King
Cetshwayo. Eva at this time had had someone to
help to build her a small hut, and she was cutting
some high grass (tambootie) near a certain kraal,
with which to thatch it. Meanwhile, illness
(influenza colds) breaking out at this kraal, poor
old Eva was accused of having caused this.
The King, through his Prime Minister,
Mnyamana, granted permission to have her
killed. On the 4th of June, 1870 (Trinity
Sunday), as we were just coming out of church,
we were surprised by a large party of men
(thirty in number) meeting us outside the church
door, armed with assagais and knobkerries, with a
demand from the King that Eva should be handed
over to them to be killed! Eva ran to her
protector (my father), calling out, “Save me,
save me!” and caught hold of him round the
waist, and the men pulling her away by force
nearly tore his coat tails off. Then my younger
brother Robert (R. C. Samuelson) interfered, and
took hold of the woman, calling out, “Muyeke
bo!” (leave her); then one man, indignant with
this interference, lifted up his knobkerrie over
Robert’s head, shouting: “Ngase ngiliqumuze
ikanda kona manje” (I will break your skull
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
this moment); then, of course, the poor woman
had to go. She was driven by these thirty
men six miles into the thorn country to a
river called Idango, near the Umhlatuzi river.
We sat on the mountain, all of us, watching the
long procession, Eva leading, the row of cruel
humanity following in a long string. We watched
and prayed broken-hearted, for we all loved poor
old Eva; but it was a comfort to know she was a
Christian! At last when we could see them no
more we returned home, too dispirited to dine
that day. In the evening someone told us she
had met her fate bravely. As she went along
she prayed to be received in the Heavenly Home
of rest, where all unkindness and cruelty will end!
At Idango river they drove her to a very big pond,
where crocodiles were often seen; there they lifted
up their kerries to brain her. She then said,
“Ngogoduka <i>impela</i> namhla!” (“I will, of a
surety (indeed), go home to-day!”) They then
killed her and threw her into the pond for the
crocodiles to eat.</p>

<p class='c005' >Such was life in Zululand before the Zulu war.
And yet on the whole things had, in a way, improved
since Tshaka’s and Dingane’s days. The life of a
missionary with his family was not at all an enviable
one, although the natives had great respect for
them, knowing as they did that they lived in their
country as friends and messengers of the Gospel.
They liked the missionary, although they objected
to his religion.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>DEPARTED SPIRITS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The Zulus have a belief in the re-embodiment of
departed spirits. Of this I remember having a
practical illustration when, as a child, I was
travelling about their country with my mother.
We were about to visit a chief named Mqayikana.
His kraal was close to the road, and as we were
passing it we saw a nasty looking green snake. I
picked up a stone and threw it at the reptile. In a
moment a number of natives ran up and, seeing
the snake, called out: “Leave it alone. It is the
spirit of Mqayikana’s father which has come to
visit us. We killed a fat beast as an offering to it
to-day, and prayed that it might come and taste
the meat. For our chief Mqayikana is very ill,
and we want to induce his father not to call him
away just yet.” I was young, and possibly a little
indiscreet in those days, and replied: “Nonsense!
The snake is an accursed creature, and ought never
to be spared,” and I threw another stone at it, just
bruising its tail. “Stop! Stop! or you will suffer
for it. As it is, your white skin alone has saved you.
If you had been black you would never eat corn
any more. You would have to die the death!”
Seeing that the men were in earnest and really
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
excited, I thought it best to leave the snake alone.
Had I not done so I might have been smelt out as
a witch later on if anything had happened to
Mqayikana. We sent the chief a small peace-offering
in the shape of a packet of sugar,
apologising for my unintentional rudeness to his
father’s ghost, and I am glad to say he proved
himself not only forgiving but friendly, sending us
a fine sheep, and even inviting us to come and
take a pinch of snuff with him—a token of friendship
among the Zulus; but we, perhaps not
imprudently, begged to be excused.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
  <h2 class='c003'>UKUHLABIS’ AMADHLOZI<br /><span class='small'>(SACRIFICING TO SPIRITS)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The heathen Zulus still keep up this custom,
chiefly in times of illness and death. The phrase
means slaughtering cattle for departed ancestors,
whose spirits appear in the form of a certain snake,
which they hold sacred. It is called “Inyandezulu”,
and its colour is green with brown under the belly.
No native in old days would have dared to kill this
snake, for he would have been punished by death.
If any one is taken seriously ill at a kraal, the
doctor, who is sent for immediately, after having
examined his patient orders the relations to make
a sacrifice to the “Amadhlozi”(spirits), and pray
for the recovery of the invalid. Then a beast
has to be chosen from the herd for the purpose,
or a sheep or goat from the flock. While the
animal is being slaughtered, the chief man calls on
the “Amadhlozi”, saying, “Watch over us, O
ye spirits of our fathers, I implore! Take not
this our child away from us yet. Here we are
slaughtering this for you. Come into the hut
to-night and feast on it, I pray. Then let your
anger be turned from us, and let us keep our child.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Oh! look on us with pity, and hear us!” After
that the slaughtered animal is cut up in pieces and
hung up in a hut; even the blood is put there in
an earthen vessel. A dish of water is also taken
in and placed on the floor, and a snuff box full of
snuff beside it. They firmly believe that the
“Idhlozi” comes in at night, has a wash, a pinch
of snuff, and a taste of the meat and blood, and
then returns into its hole again in a more forgiving
mood. When the hut is entered in the morning
nothing is seen of the “Idhlozi”, not even any
marks on the meat to show that it has tasted it at
all, still they firmly believe the hut has been
visited. The “usu” (paunch) is then taken out
and given to the doctor for medical use. He has
it boiled together with herbs and medicines, then
he steams his patient with the mixture, and
administers some of it inwardly. The “insonyama”
(right flank) is then cooked for the invalid,
and he has to have a piece of it to eat every day as
long as it is good. It is hung up in his hut, and
there it hangs till it is quite high. It is looked
upon as a charm. The rest of the meat can be
eaten by the members of the kraal after it has been
kept over night in the hut for the “Idhlozi”
(spirit). Another beast has to be killed for the
doctor’s special use while attending his patient.
If the patient dies, an “Umtakati” (wizard) is
blamed for it, and an “Ungoma” (witch doctor) is
at once engaged to find him out. The doctor has
nothing to do with that. He receives his fee and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
goes home. Soon after he leaves, the burial takes
place privately. No outsiders are allowed to be
present. The corpse is made to sit up, and tied in
this posture. It is taken out to the grave, which
is dug outside the hut, and seated in it. A stone
is placed on the head to steady it, and all the
deceased’s possessions, clothing, mats, blankets,
etc., are brought out and put into the grave—no
one dares to keep any of them, for they are
superstitious about it, believing that to use them
would cause more deaths. There is no ceremony
over the grave. Soon after it has been filled in, a
mass of thorny bushes is stuck over it to keep
“Abatakati” (wizards) from taking the body out
to use in killing others. People then come in great
numbers all round the kraal, crying out as loud
as they can, “Maye babo! wafa wen ’owakiti”
(“Woe, father! you died, you of our house”).
They don’t speak to the mourners that day, but
return home after having had a good cry. All the
relations who were at the funeral hurry off to the
river soon after it is over to have a bathe. When
they return, another beast is killed as a sacrifice to
the “Idhlozi”, with earnest prayers for the safety
of the rest of the family. While it is being kept in
the hut for “Idhlozi” to taste, all the members of
that kraal have to chew medicines before partaking
of anything, even a pinch of snuff. These medicines
are used as a preventive against death.</p>

<p class='c005' >The natives mourn in this way. They throw
aside all their ornaments for at least two months.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
They also have their heads shaved. They do not,
as a rule, go out visiting during the two months of
mourning, and they are not expected to go to
dances or any festivities. They keep at home
quietly. Absent relatives are all expected to come
home for a couple of days to take medicine, and
the comforting doctor comes with some of a
soothing character. After ten days are over,
visitors may come to “kala” (sympathize). They
come quietly into the house of mourning, and sit
down mute with their heads bent low for some
time, and with arms crossed over the shoulders.
At last a feeble voice is heard to say “Sanibona”
(“We see you”): they answer, “Haw! sikubona
ngapi ufelwe nje. Siya kala wena wakiti!” (Oh!
how do we see you having lost. We sympathize
with you”). The visitors sit about an hour or two
in the same position, quietly, as no conversation is
permitted on such an occasion. They then go out
without saying a word of farewell, only casting sad
looks towards the mourners. During the two
months of mourning a smelling Doctor is engaged
to find out the witch or wizard, and the way this
is done will be seen in the “Ingoboco” (Chief
Witch Doctor) story. Any one not calling to
“kala” after the tenth day is at once suspected as
“Umtakati.” So all make a point of showing
themselves. Still the majority of them go out of
kindness, for they do possess true and sympathizing
hearts.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>CUSTOMS AND USAGES AT THE DEATH OF A ZULU CHIEF OR HEAD OF A KRAAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >As soon as a man holding the position of chief,
or head of a kraal, is dead, the corpse is placed
in a sitting posture with the back to the central
post of his hut, the limbs being doubled up and
tied together. A messenger is then sent out to call
all the wives and friends of the deceased, and they,
being collected in one place, set up a loud wailing,
sufficient one would say to “waken the dead.”
The next thing is to separate the cows from their
calves, so that they also make a most deafening
noise, the calves lowing for their mothers, the cows
lowing for their calves.</p>

<p class='c005' >The first outburst of grief having subsided, the
sons and friends proceed to dig the grave. The
eldest son begins first, as, according to native
belief, the ground will then soften and yield more
easily to the other diggers. He then hands on
the hoe, which is the digging tool most generally
used, to the son who is next in importance to
himself, and so it is passed on in rotation till the
grave is ready. The eldest son (inkosana), after
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
doing his part, takes the barbed assagai which
belonged to his father as head of the house, and
stands holding it with the point to the ground until
the work of digging is finished. A barbed assagai
is handed down from generation to generation in
native families, the holder being always the chief
or head of the family or the acknowledged heir and
successor, and in cases of disputed succession it is
of the greatest importance to ascertain who held
the assagai at the grave, and who began the
digging, as well as who is the present possessor of
the assagai.</p>

<p class='c005' >After the hole has been dug stones are placed in
the grave for the body to be seated on, and it is
set there by one of the sons of the chief wife, the
man whose right it is to do this holding an important
position on the right-hand side of the
kraal.</p>

<p class='c005' >When the grave has been filled in, the relations
and friends go through the “ukugeza” or cleansing
ceremony, taking a small portion of a powder
made of three kinds of bitter roots. Through
the taking of this powder it is supposed that death
will be averted from the friends of the deceased,
and that any ill effects which might arise from
his death will be prevented. After this they all
go down to the river and bathe, and the wailing
is over.</p>

<p class='c005' >They then go into mourning for periods of time
which vary from a few weeks to a whole year,
according to the rank of the person mourned.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
The wife, children, and nearest relations show
their mourning by allowing their hair to grow long.
When the appointed time is over all the family and
friends are again assembled and, the doctor being
in attendance, a goat is killed, this being essential
in the latest stage of the ceremonies. A decoction
of bitter roots is made, and the gall of the goat
emptied into it. The whole is then worked up into
a froth, whilst the spirit of the dead man is called
upon to take care of his children and to supply all
their needs. Some of the mixture is sprinkled
upon those who are present, the young people cut
their hair short, and the old ones shave their heads;
a bathe in the river follows, and the mourning is
over.</p>

<p class='c005' >When the head of a kraal dies, the whole kraal is
removed to a fresh site. It must, however, remain
for a year if he was a king or an hereditary chief,
because in that case he would be buried there, and
his grave must be carefully guarded against witches
for that space of time.</p>

<p class='c005' >The graves of the kings in the Zulu country
have always been watched, a kraal being erected
near for the purpose. Should it happen that the
inkosikazi (chief wife) has had no male issue, the
head of the family can, on the marriage of his eldest
daughter, use the ukulobola cattle received for her
to buy a wife for himself or for some of his sons,
and thus raise up male issue to be heirs to such
head man’s principal house.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>INKATA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Before giving a description of an Inkata I must
explain that it is not at all the same thing as the
ordinary grass pad for supporting burthens on the
head which goes by that name.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The Inkata now
described is a larger thing, made of certain fibres
which are very strong and binding. The doctor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
specially deputed to make it knows exactly what
fibres to use. He makes it in secret, sprinkles it
with various concoctions, and finally winds the
skin of a python round it, as this reptile is considered
the most powerful of animals, coiling itself
round its prey and squeezing it to death, as it does.
When the Inkata is finished all the full-grown men
as well as the principal women of the tribe are
summoned, and are sprinkled and given powders of
various dried herbs to swallow. The men then go
down to a river and drink certain mixtures, bathe
in the river, and return to the kraal where the
Inkata is made. They are then sprinkled a second
time, and return to their homes.</p>

<p class='c005' >After this the Inkata is handed over by the doctor
to the chief’s principal wife, and entrusted to her
and to two or three others, to be withdrawn from
the common gaze. It is taken great care of and
passed on from generation to generation as part of
the chief’s regalia. The Inkata is looked upon as
the good spirit of the tribe, binding all together in
one, and attracting back any deserter.</p>

<p class='c005' >The king or chief uses it on all great occasions—more
especially on those of a civil nature. For
instance, when a new chief is taking up the reins
of government, the Inkata is brought out of its
hiding-place, a circle is formed by the tribe, and it
is placed on the ground in the centre. The new
chief then, holding his father’s weapons, stands on
the Inkata while he is being proclaimed by his
people. After this it is carefully put away again.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
In case of the king being taken ill the doctor seats
him on the Inkata while he is “treating” him (elapa).
It is also used in a variety of other royal ceremonies,
and is looked upon as more sacred than the
English Crown. It is, in fact, the guardian spirit
or totem of a Zulu tribe. Yet, strange to say, it
appears that nothing was known to the Judges of
the Native High Court as to the existence of the
Inkata, in a very important case<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> not long since
tried there, when it was what might be termed the
very essence of the case, and possibly injustice
resulted from this ignorance of native laws and
customs.</p>

<p class='c005' >The word seems to be almost universal in the Bantu
languages:—Nyanja, nkata; Luganda, enkata; Swahili,
kata; Suto, khare. What is most curious is that, so far
away as the Gold Coast we find an indication of ceremonial
usages connected with this article. See the Journal of
the African Society for July, 1908, p. 407. The Fanti word
for it is ekar, which may be a merely accidental resemblance,
or may point to a fundamental identity of roots in the
West African and the Bantu languages.</p>

<p class='c005' >Possibly the root idea of-kata is “something coiled or
rolled up,” and this may be the only connection between the
head-pad and the charm. The Baronga (Delagoa Bay) have
a similar tribal talisman called mhamba, which is a set of
balls, each containing the nail-parings and hair of a deceased
chief, kneaded up with the dung of the cattle slaughtered at
his funeral, and no doubt some kind of pitch to give it
consistency. These balls are then enclosed in plaited leather
thongs. The custom of thus preserving relics of dead chiefs
is found elsewhere: the Cambridge Ethnological Museum
possesses a set of the “regalia” of Unyoro, which would
come under the same category.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

  <h2 class='c003'>THE ZULU ANNUAL FEAST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >This feast was always arranged to take
place at about Christmas time. Men of all ages
were requested to go; even young boys had to
appear at it from all parts of Zululand. Those
who were missed at this great gathering, and who
were reported as being too aged to take the long
journey, were ordered to be “sent home” by the
king. Everyone had to bring his ornaments to
adorn his person, and deck himself out suitably.
These ornaments consisted of different coloured
ox tails, feathers, and beads. Those who had
distinguished themselves in battle wore horns of
bravery besides, and certain kinds of roots round
their necks. They also had to take food with
them—enough to last for a week or longer—for
the gathering always lasted four days at the least,
and most of the people had to take long journeys
to get to it. There were four different ceremonies
to go through at that time in connection with
“Ukunyatela” (feast of first fruits), and “Umkosi”
(the feast). On the first day the ceremony of
strangling a black bull and pulling it to pieces
by mere force was performed. Mbonambi, the
best and strongest regiment, was picked out to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
do this. Sometimes the black bull picked out
for the purpose would happen to be grazing by
the river, and the poor beast had to be attacked
and pulled to pieces there; or sometimes it
would take place in the king’s cattle kraal, and he
would be present looking on. If done by the river
side, all parts of the ox had to be carried home and
placed before the king, so that he could see that
it had been done without the assistance of knives,
choppers or assagais. The beef was not to be
eaten on any account. The next to handle it were
the doctors. They brought a mixture of all sorts
of medicines with which to smear the meat; but
the king must have a dose of it first. This was
to give him a brave and cruel heart. When the
king had taken his dose, the doctors used their
mixed medicines to smear over all the beef and
prepare it for roasting. Meanwhile the king’s
regiment, the Ingobamakosi (bend or humble),
was busy getting wood to use for the purpose.
This was supposed to be a great honour, and
the king would pick a regiment specially for it.
The doctors finished their allotted task and the
Ingobamakosi arrived with the wood. They
then cut strips of beef and roasted it until it was
black. This was done by the Ingobamakosi at
the last feast before the Zulu war. For, being
the king’s favourite regiment, he granted them
more privileges than all the other regiments put
together, and they were greatly envied on that
account. It was galling to the rest that this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
young and proud corps was picked to roast
the daubed beef! for it gave them the right to
have the first taste of the medicines after the
king. If they went to battle, these would give
them courage and make them fight to the last.
They would never think of retreating. The men
did not take the medicines in the same manner
as the king. An officer would take a strip of
roasted meat, bite a small piece off, suck the juice
and swallow that only, spitting the meat out again,
then pass the rest of the meat on to his men, and
they would do the same. Then all the other
regiments would follow suit. The meat was not
passed in at all a polite way; it was simply tossed
up high into the air, and the next one had to catch
it, take a bite, and toss it up again. After this the
bones and horns of the beast had to be burnt to
cinders. During these four days all the young
lads old enough to join a corps had to “kreza.”
This is to draw the milk into their mouths and
drink it warm, preparing themselves thereby to
be made into a corps. The king would meanwhile
choose a fitting name for the new regiment.</p>

<p class='c005' >A month before the feast the king generally
sent a party of four men and two boys to the
beach to look for a certain vegetable marrow
growing near the sea. This species grows wild
there, and has never been cultivated. Sometimes
the marrow would be ready to pick early in the
season and sometimes late; and the time to begin
the annual feast greatly depended upon this. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
could not commence operations without knowing
that the vegetable was ready, for it had to be used
on the second day. Therefore the party sent off
in search of it had to stay on the coast until it was
fit to pick; they were on no account whatever
to return without it. On its arrival all is
ready for the second day’s performance, which
proceeds as follows: The king and party rise
very early and enter the great cattle kraal. Here
the marrow is presented to the king, who receives
and inspects it very carefully, and says a few words
in a low voice over it, all the chief men standing
round about him expectantly. Then the ceremony
of tossing the marrow commences. The king
throws it up in the air five or six times, catching it
again like a ball, after that he throws it to the men,
when it breaks perhaps into two or three pieces, and
these again he throws to the men, and they by
turns go through the same performance. Then
they throw the broken pieces over the kraal to all
the different regiments drawn up round it awaiting
their turn at the tossing. This goes on until all
have touched the marrow and broken it into small
pieces. Then the king picks out of his herd
another black bull, fiercer than the one of the day
before, to be treated in the same way. It is
said that it gives the warriors bravery and
cruelty. At noon, when all the ceremonies are
over, the king declares the “Feast of first fruits”
at an end. He allows reed instruments (umtshingo
and ivenge) to be played all through the country,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
so that all people may know they may now begin
to eat green mealies, vegetable marrows, and
pumpkins. Before the umtshingo and ivenge are
heard no one may touch anything fresh out of the
gardens, no matter how long the fruit or vegetables
have been ripe (even if the people are starving), on
penalty of death, or, later on, a heavy fine. It was
against the laws of the country, too, to play the
reed instruments before the king gave the order,
being considered a greater offence even than eating
green mealies before “Ukunyatela” (to tread) had
taken place, for it was misleading the people; therefore
the punishment for this offence was certain
death. Umtshingo is the long hollow reed the
natives play tunes on. It is a kind of flute; there
is no string to it. The ivenge is a short one with
only two notes. Two of these instruments have
to be played together to make a tune at all. The
favourite air played on them is, “Ucakide ka bon’
indod’ isegunjini” (the weasel doesn’t see the man
who is in the corner). Some natives can play
several nice tunes on the long reed.</p>

<p class='c005' >The great dance commences about 3 p.m.
All have to “vunula” first (put on their ornaments).
They, of course, grease themselves well
to make their dark bodies sleek and supple. All
chiefs have black feathers of the indwa bird
stuck in the centre of their head ring, just above
the forehead. The younger chiefs wear black
ostrich feathers in the same way. The grand old
Mbonambi regiment carried plumes of black ostrich
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
feathers. A shape of straw was first made (like
the crown of a hat) and the feathers were neatly
stitched on to cover it all. These plumes looked
very graceful as the men came dancing and bowing
before the king. All the regiments would simultaneously
beat their shields with knobkerries, and
the noise would re-echo over the mountains like a
fearful peal of thunder. The regimental ornaments
varied a great deal, as they were chosen to
mark the different corps. The rest of the afternoon,
until dark, was spent in dancing and singing
“Ingoma ye nkosi” (National Anthem). The
words were as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c016'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Abafo besab’ inkosi (Strangers fear the king),</div>
      <div class='line'>Konj’ uyaliwa (By the by you are rejected),</div>
      <div class='line'>Bamzonda bamyoliza (They hate him, they praise him);</div>
      <div class='line'>Konj’ uyaliwa” (By the by you are rejected).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005' >It sounded really grand to hear thousands of men
singing it, dancing, and keeping time with their
feet, the words giving somewhat the effect of a
“round,” and the trampling of feet resembling
distant thunder. The next morning, on looking
round at the fields where the dance had taken place,
one would find the grass beaten into the ground.</p>

<p class='c005' >The third day is usually spent in feasting and
drinking beer. The king orders his chiefs to deal
out a certain number of cattle to each regiment for
slaughter early in the morning, so as to give them
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
plenty of time to prepare the meat, and to have it
cooked by noon, when the feast commences. After
all the meat has been devoured beer is brought
round, and those who serve it out have to taste it
first in front of everybody to show that it has not
been poisoned. This is a standing rule at all beer
drinks. No one will drink the beer before it has
been tasted. The men sit down in circles, and the
one who heads the circle has the first drink, and
passes the earthen vessel to the next, and it travels
all round the circle and comes back to him again,
then he takes another drink and passes it; this is
repeated till there is no beer left. Talking goes on
all the time—relating anecdotes, questioning and
arguing as to which regiment danced the best,
looked the best, or distinguished itself the most in
any way. Now and then an “Imbhongi” (jester)
comes forward, shouting praises to the king, and
jumping about like a maniac, with long horns fixed
on his forehead. He acts the wild bull, tearing the
ground up with his horns, then leaps into the air,
shouting the king’s praises all the time. The people
have to show their approval by praising and thanking
him for his wonderful feats of agility. This
afternoon the doctors are uncommonly busy
preparing “Imshikaqo yemiti” (the mixture of
medicines), to be ready for use the next day. The
officers also are busy choosing places where the
doctoring is to be done.</p>

<p class='c005' >On the fourth day each man in every regiment
has to take the mixture of medicines, which acts as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
an emetic. In order to be fully prepared for the
effects of the medicine, each regiment, in its allotted
place, digs a deep trench. This is done very early
in the morning. It is said by many who took this
mixture that it made their hearts feel very bad
indeed, full of cruelty and daring. This is the day,
too, when the men felt most inclined to fight in
order to try their strength. They would break out
quite unexpectedly, without waiting orders from
their king. At the last feast given before the Zulu
war the ground was actually strewn with the dying
and the dead. The blood of the favourite Ingobamakosi
regiment being heated and poisoned by
the “Imshikaqo,” they dashed forward to try
their strength against another noted regiment,
which, jealous of them, had been constantly
provoking them to fight.</p>

<p class='c005' >Late in the afternoon of this great doctoring day
the chiefs had to call up their men to stand before
the king and hear the new laws given out. Soon
after this, “ukubuta” (collecting) takes place. The
boys who have come to “Kreza” (milk into their
mouths), come forward to be “Butwa” (made into
a regiment). The name is chosen and given out.
So the lads go home holding their heads up high
with pride, shouting as they go along, “We are
soldiers of the king.” After this has been done the
king addresses the people, and fines those heavily
who have been fighting and shedding blood. Then
he praises those who have behaved best, and finally
bids them all go home in peace. A good many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
men generally volunteered to stay on and “konza”
(serve the king). There was always plenty of work
for them to do in the fields, weeding mealies and
minding amabele (Kafir corn) gardens—keeping the
destructive little birds away from eating them.
There was also a good deal of fencing to be done,
for the king’s kraal was an uncommonly large one,
and had always to be kept neat and tidy. The
men who volunteered to stay and work had to keep
themselves in food. Very often they would run
short and live only on water for days. Their people
had to come long distances with it, carrying it on
their heads, and sometimes they could ill be spared
from home. They got no pay for their work, but a
beast was given them occasionally for slaughter
when all the work was finished. By the time they
had to leave, a good many of them were reduced to
mere skeletons, and could barely manage to drag
themselves home.</p>

<p class='c005' >The annual feast is now a thing of the past, as
there is no king, so is also the “Feast of the first
fruits.” The only part of it they keep up is taking
a dose of the mixture each year before eating
green mealies or vegetables. This they regard
as a help towards making the green food agree
with them, and that is all.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
  <h2 class='c003'>UKUQWANJISWA KWEMPI<br /><span class='small'>(THE DOCTORING OF AN ARMY)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >This was a most important ceremony among the
Zulus while they were still under their own rulers.
The natives of Zululand, as all who know anything
of their history will admit, were the bravest and
most warlike of the coloured races, and were always
ready to fight for their king and country. They
never shirked their duty as soldiers, they were all
trained to arms from boyhood, and felt it a disgrace
not to go out against the foe whenever called
upon to do so.</p>

<p class='c005' >The ceremony of Ukuqwamba was invariably
performed when there was to be war, and was
supposed to make the men both brave and invulnerable.</p>

<p class='c005' >A proclamation went forth to all the men, in the
word “Maihlome” (Let them arm), and in a very
short time the whole manhood of the nation
mobilized and proceeded, fully equipped for war, to
the chief kraal of the sovereign, encamping within
a short distance. No women were permitted to
come near, all supplies of food or other necessaries
being brought by men or boys specially deputed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
for this service. The army, having assembled at
its rendezvous, was then formed into a crescent,
and the national war-doctor marched up in all his
war-paint, when a very wild black bull was brought
in, seized by some warriors selected for the
occasion, and held down by them, while the doctor
killed it by a blow with his axe on the nape of the
neck. Meanwhile a large fire was lighted, and kept
up while the beast was being flayed. Then its flesh
was cut into long narrow strips, which were roughly
roasted in the fire under the superintendence of the
doctor, rubbed with a powder made of various roots
and herbs and portions of the skins of lions and
other fierce animals, and tossed up into the air
among the soldiers, who had to catch them in their
mouths, bite off a piece, and pass the rest on, till
everyone had had a mouthful. Any piece which
might chance to fall on the ground was left
there.</p>

<p class='c005' >The doctor’s attendants now brought him vessels
full of a liquid composed of various medicines
pounded and mixed with water, and the doctor
sprinkled the warriors with it, shouting the while,
“Umabope kabope, Umabope kabope” (let the
Mabope tie up, that is, concentrate the strength of
the army).<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> All were now ready, and without
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
further delay set out to fight. The “tshela” (tela)
or sprinkling was repeated in case of a reverse, but
not the killing of a bull.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005' >The whole body was now drawn up in a crescent,
representing the two horns of a bull about to thrust
at the enemy, while the central part represented
the face of the bull, which would drive them
away.</p>

<p class='c005' >The war-doctor brings with him all the things
required for carrying out the rites I have described,
namely, an axe with a sharp point, a knife, the
different medicines, and the sprinkler. This should
be made of the tail of the gnu, or if this cannot be
obtained, the tail of a black bull is used. All these
things the doctor keeps in his own possession,
carefully wrapped up in a mat.</p>

<p class='c005' >The whole of these ceremonies were gone through
just before the Zulu war of 1879, and in addition
to this the fighting men partook of a medicinal
charm which was to repel the enemy (Intelezi
yempi).</p>

<p class='c005' >We must not forget the women-folk who were
left behind. Married women always wear a skirt
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
made of ox-hide, the hair having been scraped off.
In ordinary life the upper edge of this is rolled
outward, round the hips, but during war they turn
the roll inside. The young girls throw ashes over
their bodies, a sign of mourning, as wearing sackcloth
and ashes was among the Hebrews. The old
women take their brooms and run along the roads
sweeping with them, thus indicating that they
would make a clean sweep of their enemies in all
directions. This they call Ukutshaluza.</p>

<p class='c005' >Women also drink similar medicines to those
taken by the men, but the preparation of them is
somewhat different. A big fire is lighted outside
the kraal, and a pot containing a number of roots
possessing magical properties is put on, and left to
simmer slowly till next morning, when the fresh
milk of a cow is added, to whiten it. This is supposed
to bring good luck. When it is ready, all
the women and children sit round the pot, dip their
fingers in it, and lick off the mixture. This is the
Ukuncinda, or ceremony of sucking. After this, a
cow is slaughtered for them to eat. Then they
begin to sweep, smear the floors of their huts with
cow-dung, and make all tidy. This is evidently to
prepare for the return of the soldiers. Beer is
made, and snuff ground, and all the snuff-boxes
filled up, so that nothing shall be wanting.</p>

<p class='c005' >The Zulus “fight and die”; there is no turning
back, no retreating—for that only means death in
the end, an inglorious death instead of a glorious
one. Any who turned back would be killed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
order of the king or chief. This was the law of
the country in war-time.</p>

<p class='c005' >When attacking, the whole body of men made
one big rush forward, shouting their clan name or
war-cry, “Usutu!” or “Mandhlakazi!”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> &amp;c., as
the case might be.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>INGOBOCO<br /><span class='small'>(FINDING OUT WIZARDS)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The office of Detector of Wizards was held by
the Chief of Izanusi. He was the one chosen by
the king to decide abatakati (wizard) cases. A
big Umkamba tree, standing with its wide outstretched
branches between Mahlabatini and
Ulundi Military Kraals, was the place where he
took the appeal cases. (The former was Mpande’s
headquarters and the latter Cetshwayo’s.) He
heard only the most complicated cases in which
the majority of people were dissatisfied with the
inferior Zanusi’s (detector of wizards) decision. I
happened to be paying a short visit to these kraals
during Cetshwayo’s reign, when one morning early
I saw a great number of people collected under the
Umkamba tree, and on asking a native standing by
what these men were assembled for was told that
the king’s chief, Sangoma, was about to “Bul’ingoboco”
(inquire into the wizard’s case whether the
right judgment had been given). Then my friend
and I went near the place to observe the proceedings.
We saw the demoniacal Umgoma standing
with his dreaded magic wand in his right hand, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
black tail of “Inkonkoni” (gnu), and making fearful
deep noises in his throat (bodhla), calling the spirits
to help him to touch the right man with his wand.
While doing this he would be walking round and
round the people, now and then making sudden
leaps into the air like a maniac, flourishing his
dreaded wand, and all the accused would be
awaiting the final touch with fear and trembling.
The Imigoma (doctors) who had partly heard the
cases would also be present, as well as relations of
the accused, but none of them were supposed to
say anything to the Ingoboco man: the amadhlozi
(spirits) were to instruct him in everything. After
having gone on till thoroughly exhausted with the
antics described, he suddenly stops near his victim,
whom he touches on the head with the Inkonkoni
tail. The poor man has then to be taken off at
once without even a word of remonstrance or a
last farewell from his relations. He is driven off
to Kwankata, a precipice over a deep pond in the
Mfolozi River, which is full of crocodiles. This
place is at no great distance from Ulundi. Having
reached it the poor victim would be first stoned,
then thrown down the precipice into the pond,
where the crocodiles were always in readiness to
receive him. They really lived on human beings.</p>

<p class='c005' >Happily the morning we were watching Ingoboco
the victim escaped most marvellously by
running off at once to the king, who was standing
in the cattle kraal, and throwing himself down at his
feet, pleading for mercy, which was granted at once
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
as a reward for his pluck and running powers.
I am told that several others managed to save
themselves in the same way, for it was quite an
understood thing that if a man reached the king,
outstripping all his pursuers, he would be saved.
This also held good if a man reached King
Mpande’s grave in safety. No one would dare to
touch him there.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004' >Icimamlilo is the name of a compound which is
in use among the heathen Zulus in cases of murder
or homicide, and so well is this known that if any
person were found using it after a murder had been
committed, that person would be strongly suspected
of the crime. It consists of four or five kinds of
very bitter roots, with pieces of the flesh of the
following animals: a lion, a baboon, a jackal, a
hyena, and an elephant, also a kind of hawk. All
of these ingredients are essential, there are others
which may be added, but which are not absolutely
necessary. After all these things have been burnt
to ashes and thoroughly mixed, the murderer or
homicide swallows some of the powder, and mixing
the rest with water sprinkles himself and goes off
for a bathe; then the purification is complete, and
any evil effects upon the system which, according
to native superstition may follow the killing of a
human being, are counteracted. This custom of
purification is still strictly kept up by the heathen
natives, as a preventive against their own death,
which they believe might otherwise naturally take
place as a consequence of having killed another.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>RAIN DOCTORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >In common with other backward races the Zulus
have faith in the power of the rain doctors to
make, or to draw, rain, and also to prevent it from
falling. The Zulu kings generally kept rain
doctors; but as these men, when they did not
make enough rain to please their royal masters,
were in danger of being fined or even put to death,
they were obliged to invent a good many excuses
for their failures. The most common was that
they felt sure somebody was practising witchcraft,
that is to say, putting pegs dipped in medicine into
the ground, or tying knots in the grass on the
mountain-tops and sprinkling them with medicines,
either of which proceedings would stop the rain.
Then the king would send messengers round the
country commanding his subjects to find out where
pegs had been driven in, or knots tied in the
grass, and the owner of the kraal in whose neighbourhood
this was found to have been done was
liable to be killed or fined, at the king’s discretion.
In a dry season people were constantly in fear of
this happening, for they knew that any who wished
to injure them would drive in pegs near their kraals
and then report them to the king for having
done it.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
Cetshwayo once had a rain doctor of whom he
thought a great deal; but one year when there was
a terrible drought he lost faith in him, and then
someone accused him to the king of having wilfully
prevented the rain from falling. Of course this
made his majesty furiously angry, and he ordered
the unfortunate man to be killed and thrown into
the river, together with his hut and everything he
possessed. No sooner was this order carried out
than the rain fell in torrents. Such is the story told
by the natives, but I cannot vouch for the truth of it.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005' >The Zulus used to consider the Basuto rain
doctors the best of any, and the king sometimes
engaged some of them to come to Zululand when
rain was wanted. One year a large number of
them arrived, laden with roots and other medicines,
from Basutoland. Some carried calabashes filled
with liquids, which were rolled about on the ground
at the cattle-kraal to bring thunder, and bundles
containing charms to bring lightning and rain were
stuck upright in the ground. These performances
went on for some weeks, until at last the rain came,
and the Zulus were satisfied that it was caused by
the hard work of the Basuto doctors. These men
were kept well supplied with beef and beer all the
time they were in the country, and handsome
presents were given them when they left it to return
to their own land.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>THE RAINBOW, LIGHTNING, AND ECLIPSES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The Zulus believe in a glorious being whom
they call the Queen of Heaven, of great and
wondrous beauty, and the rainbow is supposed to
be an emanation of her glory. This “Queen of
Heaven” (Inkosikazi) is a different person from the
Heavenly Princess, to whom the young girls pray
regularly once a year, as described on another
page.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
Some believe that there is a gorgeously coloured
animal at the point where the rainbow appears to
come in contact with the earth, and that it would
cause the death of any who caught sight of it.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005' >The natives as a rule are very superstitious about
the lightning; if it has struck anything they say
“the heavens did it,” they dare not speak of it by
name. A person killed by lightning is buried
without ceremony, and there is no mourning for
him; a tree which has been struck may not be
used for fuel; the flesh of any animal so killed is
not to be eaten; huts which have been injured by
lightning are abandoned, and very often the whole
kraal is removed. Persons living in such a kraal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
may not visit their friends, nor may their friends
visit them, until they have been purified and pronounced
clean by the doctor. They are not allowed
to dispose of their cattle until they also have been
attended to by the doctor: even the milk is
considered unclean, and people abstain from
drinking it.</p>

<p class='c005' >An eclipse or an earthquake foretells a great
calamity, and the natives are terrified whenever an
eclipse takes place. The defeat of Cetshwayo by
Usibebu a few hours after an earthquake, which
was felt all through Zululand in 1883, naturally
confirmed them in the belief that it is an evil
omen.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

Bow.” See Callaway, <i>Nursery Tales and Traditions of the
Zulus</i>, p. 193. Utingo, however, is not “a bow” in our
sense (at any rate not in current Zulu speech), but a bent
stick or wattle, such as is used in making the framework of
a hut. It is difficult to ascertain anything about this
inkosikazi; but the Zulu women hold dances on the hills in
honour of some Inkosazana—an echo, it may be, of the
story of Jephtha’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c005' >Mr. Dudley Kidd (<i>The Essential Kafir</i>, p. 112) seems to
have confused her with Nomkubulwana, who, as Miss
Samuelson expressly tells us, is not the same person. It is
not clear whether she is identical with the mysterious being
called “Inkosazana,” of whom the late Bishop Callaway
says: “The following superstition ... appears to be the
relic of some very old worship” (<i>Religious System of the
Amazulu</i>, p. 253).</p>

<p class='c005' >She was supposed to appear, or rather to be heard speaking
(for she was never seen), in lonely places, and predicted
the future, or gave directions which had to be obeyed by the
people. “It is she who introduces many fashions among
black men. She orders the children to be weaned earlier
than usual.... Sometimes she orders much beer to be
made and poured out on the mountain. And all the tribes
make beer, each chief and his tribe; the beer is poured on
the mountain; and they thus free themselves from blame....
I never heard that they pray to her for anything, for
she does not dwell with men, but in the forest, and is
unexpectedly met with by a man who has gone out about his
own affairs, and he brings back her message.”—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

some ten miles from Melmoth, when, about midnight, the
wagonette in which we were sleeping was shaken and began
to move down hill, but was fortunately stopped after a few
yards by a block of wood lying in the grass. The natives
who were near us exclaimed that it meant a calamity
to the Zulu nation. And in the morning, when we
got down from the wagonette, we found a great number of
men sitting about looking sad, with their arms over their
shoulders (meaning “we are lost”). They told us that
Cetshwayo had been killed by Usibebu; in fact, the latter
had made a clean sweep of the royal kraal and all the king’s

some running, some limping, some crawling past us, who had

Eshowe, where he died early in the following year. (See

<p class='c004' >A description of an old Zulu custom which
is now slowly dying out may be found interesting.
It is generally observed at the season when the
mealies and mabele (Kafir corn) are coming into
flower.</p>

<p class='c005' >The Zulus believe that there is a certain Princess
in Heaven, who bears the name of Nomkubulwana
(Heavenly Princess), and who occasionally visits
their cornfields and causes them to bear abundantly.
For this princess they very often set apart
a small piece of cultivated land as a present, putting
little pots of beer in it for her to drink when she
goes on her rounds. They often sprinkle the
mealies and mabele with some of the beer, for luck
to the harvest.</p>

<p class='c005' >There is one day appointed specially for girls,
when they go out fasting on to the hills, and
spend the whole day weeping, fasting, and praying,
as they think that the more they fast and weep the
more likely they are to be pitied by the princess.
On that day they have to wear men’s clothing
(umutsha) made of skins, and all men and boys are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
to keep out of their way, neither speaking to them
nor looking at them.</p>

<p class='c005' >They start very early, as by sunrise they must

weeping.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005' >Digging deep holes in the sand, they make two

above ground. There they must remain, weeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
and praying for some time. Girls about six years
old are generally chosen for this purpose, as they
cry the most (rather from fright than anything else),

(Vol. II., p. 12), as follows: “Among the charms to prevent
sickness from visiting a kraal is the umkuba, or custom of
the girls herding the cattle for a day. [Umkuba means
“custom,” it is not the name of this particular rite.] No
special season of the year is set apart for this custom. It is
merely enacted when diseases are known to be prevalent. On
such an occasion all the girls and unmarried women of a
kraal rise early in the morning, dress themselves entirely in
their brothers’ skins [<i>i.e.</i>, skin kilts (umutsha)], and, taking
their knobkerries and sticks, open the cattle-pen or kraal, and
drive the cattle away from the vicinity of the homestead, none
of these soi-disant herds returning home, or going near a
kraal, until sunset, when they bring the cattle back. No one of
the opposite sex dare go near the girls on this day, or speak
to them.”—We have reproduced the passage in full, as the
periodical which contains it is now very scarce. It should
be noted that at ordinary times it would be contrary to
custom—indeed, highly improper, if not sacrilegious—for
any woman or girl to approach the cattle-kraal, to say nothing
of herding the cattle. The idea is, no doubt, to compel the
assistance of the Unseen by some flagrant outrage on decency,

  <h2 class='c003'>OLD WIVES’ TALES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >In addition to the many beliefs amongst the
Zulus, of which I have given some examples, which
may be properly called superstitious, there are a
large number of curious half-beliefs and traditions,
something of the nature of “old wives’ tales,” to
which allusion is made more or less seriously in
the ordinary course of Zulu conversation, and
which often come as a surprise to the uninitiated
European. I remember being much struck with
some of these many years ago (as far back as in
1872), when my father took me as a child for a
journey through Zululand on a visit to the great
kraal of the celebrated King Mpande. On the
way, as I was getting somewhat tired, a friendly
Zulu told me to press my foot on an aloe (icena),
and I should not be tired any longer. I saw no
particular harm in obeying the injunction, and
whether it was from the effect of the “icena,” or a
thought cure wrought by the friendly Zulu, I
certainly managed to get on.</p>

<p class='c005' >On the same journey I was struck by a curious
idea the Zulus have (somewhat akin to our
“watched pot never boils”) as to disturbing the
ordinary processes of the vegetable kingdom. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
noticed some fine varieties of pumpkins, melons,
and marrows, and, being curious to know their
names, I pointed my finger at them. “Musa,
musa” (don’t, don’t), shouted my native conductor,
“they will never ripen if you point at them. You
ought always to bend your fingers and point with
your knuckles towards vegetables.” “Oh,” said I,
“you might perhaps pick me that pumpkin (indicating
one of the best), as it is the only one I
pointed at, and it will prevent its rotting,” and he
at once fell in with my suggestion, adding a few
marrows growing near the pumpkin, which had
also been in peril. Some of our mistakes in dealing
with the Zulus might at times lead to serious
consequences; but fortunately, as a rule they take
them good naturedly, and attribute them to our
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c005' >It is rather curious, and perhaps a little humiliating,
to civilized and superior people, to find one
of their favourite nursery tactics—the threat of the
black man coming down the chimney—in vogue
(mutatis mutandis) among the Zulus. Fond Zulu
mothers used to reduce their refractory offspring
to order by the threat, “I’ll take you away to be
eaten up by the white men,” and in the old times
of which I am now speaking the threat always
had the desired effect, though, let us hope in the
present day, the notion of our being cannibals, if
not bogies, no longer exists, even among the Zulus.</p>

<p class='c005' >I well remember the day when we were
graciously admitted to an audience with King
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
Mpande, and the curious kind of awe with which
the monarch and his attendants regarded us. The
King spoke to us through his chief official, and
courteously welcomed us to his Place, hoping we
had not been disturbed by a big fight which had
taken place in connection with some festivities
among the Zulus near to us. It was a way his
subjects had when their blood was heated, and he
had done his best to stop it. He then noticed my
long brown hair, which hung down to my waist,
and observed, “What nice tails you have adorned
yourself with! where did you get them? I should
like some like that.” I said I had a private store
from which I got them, and should not like anyone
else to know. King Mpande smiled, and took it
all in good part. I was the first white girl he had
seen, and he looked therefore upon me as a
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c005' >“Come nearer,” he said, “and take off your hat,
so that I can have a good look at you. How do
you manage to tie the tails so neatly that no
strings are seen?” He pulled and tugged at my
hair, to see whether it would come off.</p>

<p class='c005' >“Why, this is wonderful!” said he. “These
are the tails they make under the sea. There’s
nothing on land equal to this.”</p>

<p class='c005' >“I glue them on,” said I.</p>

<p class='c005' >“Wow! It is well done! Do show us how
you do it.”</p>

<p class='c005' >It was beyond human nature to keep a serious
face after that. We all burst out laughing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
together. Then I told him that it was only my
hair.</p>

<p class='c005' >“Ngimdala!” (I am old) said the king (meaning
in wisdom); and I was asked to go round for
fuller inspection. The king noticed my hands.
He said: “Her hands have a different colour to
her face! Come nearer again, let me have a look
at your hands.” I obeyed. He took my hand
and felt it all over. “Mamo!” (oh! mother) “the
skin moves. It is quite loose, and look how red it
is.” I had a pair of scarlet silk gloves on. I
pulled one off, an incident which caused a prodigious
sensation in the royal hut. Exclamations
of surprise were heard all round. “White girls
are double skinned,” said one, “on their hands.”
“They have a white skin to suit their face, and
this is covered by a loose, dark red skin,” said
the king. “Behold the artfulness of the white
beings that come out of the sea.” The glove
was carefully examined, and one man, with fear
and trembling, picked it up with the tips of his
fingers, but speedily dropped it again in horror and
dismay. My father then explained to them as best
he could that ladies wore gloves to protect their
hands from getting sunburnt, and we took leave of
the mighty king.</p>

<p class='c005' >Outside the door we were met by a number
of his royal daughters, all wanting to have a
look at the girl from under the sea and her
wonderful hair and hands. When they had satisfied
their curiosity, they asked us to come and call on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
Giba, King Mpande’s celebrated snake charmer.
He was sitting in his hut training his numerous
snakes to go and come in to and out of their holes
as he wanted them.</p>

<p class='c005' >A great monster of a python was coiled round a
stone in a corner, lazily watching his inferiors at
their drill, and waiting his turn. “Ngqabitani”
(the snake’s name, which means “hop down”),
called out Giba, and the monster made a move and
came with a twist and a roll, and was rewarded by
a fowl to eat. It was a horrible performance.</p>

<p class='c005' >The tendency which the Zulu has, in common
with all savage or half-civilized people, to ascribe
anything unusual to magic, and to account for the
unknown by fanciful analogy (the basis, indeed, of
most of the vulgar superstitions), was curiously
illustrated in this journey by a chief whom we met
and to whom my father gave a small mirror. The
Zulu looked into it, gave a start, and dropped it to
the ground. “Why, it is myself; I know, for I
have seen a reflection of myself in a clear pool.
These people carry mysterious things with them.”
He picked it up gingerly, and handed it to his
chief man, who, after examining it with the caution
that a detective might display in opening a parcel
supposed to contain dynamite, handed it round to
the attendants, each of whom made a study of the
“ego” and the “non ego” in the wonderful
“charm,” which they took to their home and
sealed up in an earthen pot.</p>

<p class='c005' >Such are some of the curious ideas which were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
entertained by the Zulus as to the white man in
the old days. Since that time increased intercourse
with the white creatures from under the sea
has dissipated some of their old delusions, but
even to this day a large number of the natives look
upon the white man as something weird, as a being
who can do anything, and who has about him a
touch of the mysterious, if not of the supernatural.
Fortunately for us these ideas have never taken a
very serious hold on the native mind. They look
upon us as strange curiosities, but do not seriously
associate our doings with the “black arts,” ready
as they are to attribute dealings with forbidden
agencies to their own people. It would have gone
hard with us in the early days if any influential
chief had conceived the idea, so readily seized by
the Chinese, of designating all Europeans “foreign
devils”—“Takati” (wizards)—with unknown
powers and malignant designs. Our just and
large-minded treatment of them has prevented the
spread of any such notions amongst them. Their
mental attitude towards us at the present day is
one of bewildered simplicity, not unmingled with
respect, and, when their confidence is obtained, with
something of the loyal affection they have long been
accustomed to entertain towards their own chiefs
and superiors.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>KING MPANDE’S SNAKE CHARMER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >During King Mpande’s reign there lived in his
chief kraal a most noted and wonderful snake-charmer,
who was spoken of far and wide with
great awe. He was looked upon as one who was
in constant communication with the spirits, as all
snakes obeyed him. He was tall and slim, with
a withered right arm and a crooked forefinger.
It was quite an easy task for him to catch snakes
in bushes, and he could even draw them out of
their holes with his crooked finger. He said he
had certain kinds of medicines which he always
took, and also injected into his right arm and finger
before setting out snake-catching in the mornings,
and these prevented snake bites having any effect
on him—in fact, he felt quite safe anywhere. He
would sometimes take long journeys in search of
various kinds of snakes, and on his return would
call on people living near the roadside that he
might exhibit them. He generally took two or
three boys with him to carry them, and they had
special bags made for them of water-broom rushes.
I shall never forget the day when the snake-charmer
called at our house and asked whether we should
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
like to see two big snakes he had caught that day.
At first we felt rather scared, although, at the same
time, we were curious to see them, for we had
heard a great deal about this snake-charmer. So
we allowed him to get them out and show us what
he could do with them. He ordered the boys to
open the bags, then gave two or three whistles,
and the snakes came crawling out very slowly and
carefully. He then drew a winding mark on the
ground with his rod, which they most obediently
followed, hissing and sticking out their tongues
now and then, and looking about to see which way
they were to go next, and he said that this was all
he had been able to teach them that morning.
He put down his rod a moment, then one of the
snakes made for the kitchen door, where three
native girls were standing, and it went part of the
way in before he could stop it. The girls were
half mad with fright; one climbed on the table,
another on the shelf, and the third went up the
chimney: there was a terrible scrimmage. But
the man soon made the snake go into the bag
again. I then thought I would have some fun, so I
went into my room to fetch a big toy snake which
I kept in the window to prevent the natives from
standing about there and using it as a mirror.
When I brought it out, moving and wriggling
about in my hand, the charmer took to flight. It
was an ugly green and yellow thing, with open
red mouth. The man said his medicines would be
no preventive against a bite from this strange
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
kind of snake, of which he knew nothing. But
when I told him it was only a toy, he had a good
laugh over his fright. Soon after his return to his
hut at the king’s kraal we heard that some
gentlemen had gone up to pay him a visit and to
ask him to let them see his snakes. When he
went away his hut would be quite safe, for the
snakes were always on the look out for strangers.
The gentlemen thought it prudent to keep at a
good distance until the owner of the hut and snakes
appeared. After the usual greetings and introductions
had been gone through, the man said, “I hear
you would like to see my pets; how much will you
pay me for it?” They answered that they were
travellers, and had not much with them, but that
they would give him a blanket each. So he made them
go into a corner of his hut and sit down on a mat.
Presently he called out “Ngqabitani”! (his chief
snake), and it came out with a majestic twist of
satisfaction. Then he whistled for another, grunted
for another, groaned for a third, hissed for a fourth,
and then rattled for the whole lot. They came out by
the dozen; the visitors found themselves surrounded
by snakes of all sorts and sizes, the great python
wriggling and twisting impatiently, with a look as
much as to say, “I could swallow the whole of you
if only my master would allow me.” The man sat
coolly at the door of his hut enjoying the fun. The
gentlemen called out, “Enough! enough! we have
seen your pets; do for pity’s sake call them back!”
The man said, “How much will you give me?”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
The answer was, “Ten blankets each—anything
you like—all we possess; only clear off your pets
and let us out of this trap.” He answered, “You
shall have your wish my good friends,” and then
made the usual noises, when they all promptly
returned to their holes. The gentlemen heaved a
sigh of relief, paid the man, but never will they ask
to see his pets again. They were quite satisfied.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>HOW DEATH CAME INTO THE WORLD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The Zulu people believe that our first parents
came out of a reed. The Great-great-one made
the reed to open, and forth came a man and a
woman. Some years after, He sent a messenger
to inform the people that they were to live for ever.
This messenger, being a chameleon, was very slow
in fulfilling its errand. On the way it espied some
nice berries, of which it is very fond, and it spent
quite an age in climbing up the shrub to pick and
eat the sweet little fruit. It thought that it
was unnecessary to hurry with the message—the
people could wait: so it was at no pains
to perform His mission. Meanwhile the Great-great-one
sent a second messenger to tell the
people that they were to die. This messenger
(being a kind of lizard, or salamander) was much
quicker in its movements, and so, arriving in the
world long before the chameleon even thought it
had had enough berries to eat, it proclaimed to
men: “The Great-great-one says you must all
die.” When at length the first-sent messenger
came, it was too late, for people were already
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
dying, and the fate of the rest could not be
changed. And they said: “Why did you delay
when sent by the Great-great-one? You detestable
little, slow, crawling creature! You shall be hated
for ever and ever.” The natives still abhor this
creature in connection with the legend. They
always ill-treat it, delighting to fill its mouth with
snuff, which turns it black.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>THE ZULU’S CHOICEST BIT OF MEAT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >If a native sends a present of meat to his chief,
or anyone he respects as far above him, he will
generally send the Insonyama, that is, the part of
the flesh of a slaughtered bullock or cow which
covers the ribs and is separated from them by a
moist substance which makes it very easy of
removal. This is, in native estimation, the choicest
meat, and is always eaten by the head of a family.
This is a useful piece of knowledge for those who
have to do with native cases which concern disputed
inheritance. If an ox is slaughtered which
belongs to any other house of the same family, the
insonyama is always taken to be eaten in the
superior’s hut. If the insonyama is taken as a
present to a superior friend, it is always considered
a great compliment to cook it beforehand and roll
it up nicely in a clean mat (isitebe) ready to be
eaten.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
  <h2 class='c003'>A FRIENDLY WAY OF OBTAINING FOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >The Zulus are a very kind and hospitable race,
always willing to share their food with others in
need. In times of famine they have a way of
asking help from each other without any intention
of returning the same; this they call Ukutekela.
Sometimes on meeting one another by the way,
after the usual greetings, one says to the other,
“I am coming to beg (tekela) mealies (or potatoes)
of you to-morrow”; the answer would be, “All
right,” with a laugh, “you may come.”</p>

<p class='c005' >Tekela really means begging or obtaining food,
corn or potatoes, from another, sometimes getting
it as a reward for assisting to reap or weed, or as a
gift. It is one of the oldest customs which the
natives have.</p>

<p class='c005' >For instance, a woman may go on a visit to
relations or friends, and remain with them for a
short time, and while staying there assist in whatever
work is going on at the time of her visit.
Then when she leaves to return home she may be
given grain of some kind to take with her, if there
is a fair supply at the kraal. A visitor hardly ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
returns home empty handed. Only in times of
famine would it be possible.</p>

<p class='c005' >Help given one to another in reaping cornfields
is very commonly acknowledged in the same
fashion.</p>

<p class='c005' >When the gardens need weeding a day is
arranged on which to invite friends to a beer-drink.
The guests arrive about sunrise and weed till about
three o’clock, when the beer is brought out; but
no one except those who have assisted in the work
will have a share in it, unless they happen to be
travellers or too old to work.</p>

<p class='c005' >Natives will do a great deal to obtain beer, which
is the reason why the native fields are usually so
free from weeds. But it is seldom used before the
allotted work is done—a very necessary restriction!</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
  <h2 class='c003'>PEACEMAKING OVER A PINCH OF SNUFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Very few people, I believe, know this Zulu custom
of making friends. After a severe quarrel natives
will not condescend to take snuff together on any
account, although they have been the best of
friends for years. It is not till their quarrel has
been settled and their tempers cooled down that
they can begin to say, “Ngi ncwebise ugwai” (give
me a pinch of snuff)—and even then the one
asked may refuse and say “’Tis too soon my
friend, irritate me not, I pray.” The following is
an instance:—</p>

<p class='c005' >Two handsome young men, who had been
friends ever since they were quite little lads, and who
had joined the same regiment, fell in love with a
very beautiful girl, who was a chief’s daughter.
These young men were inseparable; wherever the
one went the other was sure to go. Whether it
was to a hunt, beer drink, wedding, or dance they
always went together. There was a certain chief
who took a liking to these two young men, for
they were very cheerful and amusing, so he
encouraged them to come to all his entertainments.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
One used to ornament himself with white beads
and tigers’ claws and white ostrich feathers, the
other with red beads and black and red feathers.
They each carried a nice assagai and a couple of
knobkerries and a courting shield. They always
looked neat and nice, for they made a point of
greasing themselves well before setting out anywhere.</p>

<p class='c005' >This chief had a most beautiful daughter who
was greatly beloved by old and young, for she
was kind and pleasant to everybody. Her father
always chose her to serve the beer round to the
visitors, she did it so gracefully and willingly.
These two young men were greatly struck with the
girl, and both fell in love with her. The one in
red decided at once to win her, but how to set
about it was a puzzle, for he never before had gone
anywhere without his friend, and he didn’t know
what excuse to make to go off alone. But the
next day he got a very good opportunity, for
his friend was taken ill and could not attend
a dance he had promised to go to. The one in
red had to go alone and make excuses for the
other. Between the dances he got a chance to
try his luck with the young lady, and was rejected
at once for having the impudence to wear the
Royal colours. (Those red beads were worn in
those days only by royalty, also the red parrot
feathers.) This maiden thought he could not be
trusted: he would venture too much, and end by
getting killed.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
He went back disappointed and annoyed, but did
not let his friend know anything about it, for he
intended to try again. When his friend had recovered
they went together to call on the chief.
His daughter brought in some beer. It was
noticed that she paid most attention to the one in
white, and of course that gave him hope at once.
As soon as she left the hut the young man said:
“Your daughter, chief of the great house, has won
my heart. How much would you want for her?
How many head of cattle?”</p>

<p class='c005' >The chief answered, “You are a handsome,
promising lad. Of another I should ask for her sixty,
but I would let you off with thirty.”</p>

<p class='c005' >The young man was delighted with this answer.
He took the very next opportunity to propose and
was accepted.</p>

<p class='c005' >His friend was furiously angry, and swore a
solemn oath that now their friendship had come
to an end, and they would be enemies for the rest of
their lives, “For,” said he, “I was first in the field.”</p>

<p class='c005' >They parted there and then. The lucky man
sent the thirty head of cattle the very next day to
make sure of his future bride, and the matter was
properly settled. He was very happy, but still he
missed his dear old friend who had left him in
anger.</p>

<p class='c005' >Whenever they met, he said to him, “dear friend
of my youth and life, come and let us make it up.
Here, take a pinch of snuff. It was no fault of
mine you were rejected.”</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
“No, ’tis too soon. After your wedding,” said
the other, “this may be done, but I do not wish to
come to the wedding feast. May the spirits of my
ancestors pity me and save me from harming you
or her. Depart in peace!”</p>

<p class='c005' >Three months after the wedding the two friends
met under a cabbage tree, took snuff together, and
vowed to forget their grievance.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>RULES OF A ZULU HUNT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >Hunts are conducted on a large scale, and there
are certain rules which have to be kept. Generally
the most important man in the neighbourhood
proclaims it, and young boys are sent round
a day or two in advance with a few branches
of the wild cabbage tree (umsenge) in their hands
to invite those who are chosen to take part in the
sport. All who see these boys with umsenge
branches ask from them where the hunt is to take
place, and are told in answer. It is an easy way of
inviting superiors to anything, for a Zulu youth
may not address his senior without being first
spoken to.</p>

<p class='c005' >All the men invited have to meet the chief at the
starting point, armed, and with their dogs. They
dance round him and sing their hunting songs, then
they follow him to the place chosen for the hunt.
While at the hunt, if a buck is stabbed by more
than one person before it falls, it belongs to the man
who first drew blood, and the man who gave it the
next stab, or whose dog caught it after it had
received its first wound is entitled to a leg; the
man who wounded it a third time, or whose dog
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
pulled it down, takes a shoulder, if it is a large
buck, but nothing if the animal is a small one.</p>

<p class='c005' >If caught by dogs without being previously
wounded, and if it is not known whose dog was the
first to lay hold of it, the buck belongs to the
master of the hunt or the man who called the hunt
together. And it is the latter generally who
settles a disputed question of ownership; but he
cannot mend the broken heads which so often
follow such a dispute. One seldom sees natives
so excited as they over a buck killed at a hunt,
when there is any doubt as to the person to
whom the buck belongs. Many cases of assault,
and even murder, arise out of quarrels over a dead
buck. It might therefore be very useful to know
these rules.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>UBUQILI BUKA BONGOZA<br /><span class='small'>BONGOZA’S SMARTNESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004' >In the early days when the Boers invaded
Zululand the Zulus twice set traps for them, which
were very successful. They were completely
caught in both.</p>

<p class='c005' >Dingane, who was at that time King of the
Zulus, prepared the first one himself. He gave a
great beer drink in his cattle kraal, and invited all
the Boers, with their leader (Piet Retief). These
readily accepted the invitation, came, and were
highly entertained in various ways. A good many
Zulus were asked by Dingane to come and help to
entertain by singing and dancing while the tyuala
(Kafir beer) was being passed round. The Boers
enjoyed the Kafir beer immensely, as well as the
singing and dancing, little guessing what was in
store for them that day.</p>

<p class='c005' >When Dingane thought he had spent enough
time with them, he gave a sign to his people, which
had been agreed upon beforehand. He just passed
the palm of his hand over his mouth, and that
meant, “Sweep them all off the face of the earth.”
After having given this sign, he himself went out
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
of the kraal unnoticed. Hundreds of Zulus who
had been waiting outside the kraal ready armed set
to at once, and those who had been singing and
dancing joined in as soon as the sign was given them.
There was a confusion of beer pots and assagais.
The assagais came like a hailstorm upon the unfortunate
Boers. Their leader was the only one
who escaped by leaping over the cattle kraal fence
and disappearing in a most mysterious way.</p>

<p class='c005' >A few years after he came forward again with
another big commando, in hopes of settling old
scores, when he was led into another trap beyond
the White Umfolozi, at a place called Opate. He
had been troubling the Zulus a great deal all round
about Mahlabatini (where the Natal Police distinguished
themselves in the recent Boer war).
Dingane was quite at a loss what to do with them,
for he wished to put an end to it all. Amongst his
numerous chiefs he had one very smart general
called Nobongoza, who thought of a plan to catch
the Dutchmen. He had a private interview with
the king, and made his plans known to him. They
were thought to be very good indeed, for Dingane
left the management of everything to him after
that. Opate is a nice open plain, surrounded with
bushes and hills. To get to it one had to go through
a narrow pass. Nobongoza ordered a good number
of his men to drive the king’s cattle to this plain
for safety; but he really had quite another object
in view in doing this. All the natives were to go
armed, in readiness to defend the cattle in case the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
Boers should find their hiding place and try to take
them. A day after the cattle had been taken to
Opate, Nobongoza sent a big army to hide in the
bush all round the place; then he turned traitor
and went over to the Boers, saying he was tired of
fighting against them, therefore he was now willing
to lead them to a place where the king had hidden
his cattle, and they could just help themselves and
go away. Piet Retief believed what Nobongoza
said, and was quite pleased. He allowed this chief
to go as their leader, and even promised to pay him
for his trouble. So he led them through this narrow
pass, and when they had got through a fine sight
came in view—a sight that would make any Dutchman’s
heart leap for joy—the plain was alive with
fine cattle. They at once made a dash for them,
when Nobongoza suddenly disappeared in the
forest close by, where thousands of armed Zulus
were waiting for their prey. They rushed out from
the bush all round, closed in upon the Boers, and
killed every one of them. The cattle were then
driven back triumphantly to the King’s kraal,
and Nobongoza was looked upon as a hero ever
after.</p>

<p class='c005' >These historical tales are repeated to this day.
Anyone visiting Zululand might ask a Zulu to
relate to them “Ubiqili Buka Bongoza,” and it
would be told them with great glee. It is one of
the most favourite stories amongst the men.</p>

<p class='c005' >When visiting Zululand only a short time ago I
heard this story from an old Zulu warrior who is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
now over a hundred years old. He seemed to have
a very good memory still, and enjoyed relating all
his past victories. He said he was quite a little
boy when Chaka died, and he served as a soldier
under Dingane.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>LABYRINTHS AND WAR GAME</h2>

<p class='c004' >The Zulus are very fond of drawing mazes
(usogexe) on the ground with the finger, or—after
smoking hemp (insangu)—with saliva passed
through a hollow stem of tambootie grass and so
made to trace a labyrinth (tshuma sogexe) on a
smooth floor. The one who draws generally asks
some one else to find the way into the royal hut.
And this he does with a pointer of tambootie, or
failing to follow the right course and getting
cornered, is greeted with a general shout of
“Wapuka sogexe!” (you are done for in the
labyrinth), and has to go back to the start
and begin the quest again. This game is a
great favourite, and is often played for hours
at a time: the sons of Mpande were great
adepts at it. They would vary it sometimes
by dotting rows of warriors on the outside,
and then success depended on the positions
that the combatants were made to assume, the

acclaimed as winner.</p>

The above is a copy of a Labyrinth made by a Zulu, Ulutyetye,
for the well-known missionary, the Rev. R. Robertson, and
first reproduced by Messrs. John Sanderson and Co., of Durban.
It is noticeable for having two huts to be reached—that in the
centre being the Royal one.</p>
